Hi, this is Zapster Bot from ROCV. I’ll text you whenever
<?= studentNamesOr ?> zaps at the Crest View bike racks.
Specifically, I'm looking for
tag<?= multipleTags ? "s" : "" ?> <?= tagsAnd ?>.

I always send from this number, so you might add it to your
contacts. Reply STOP if you’ve heard enough, or email
zapsters@rocv.org for anything else.

That’s it for now. I hope I can text you again soon. Thanks
for supporting self-powered commuting!
