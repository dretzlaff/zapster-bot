      Hi, this is Zapster Bot from ROCV. I'm told you want to know when <?= studentNamesOr ?> zaps
      at the Crest View bike racks. I'll keep an eye out for their tag<?= multipleTags ? "s" : "" ?>
      (<?= tagsAnd ?>) and be in touch.
    </p>

      If you have questions or requests, you can respond to these emails and the Zapsters volunteer will
      get back to you. Spam filtering can be a problem for me, so consider adding me to your contacts
      (use my profile picture to see the add to contacts button?), marking this email as important, and/or
      replying to teach your email provider you want these.

    <p>
      Thatâ€™s it for now. I hope I can write you again soon. Thanks for supporting self-powered commuting!
